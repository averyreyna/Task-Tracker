## This is an application that keeps track of your tasks with a to-do list! Once you run `Application.java`, your to-do list will be displayed on the table.

### How do I add an item to my list?

Once you fill out all the text fields (your description and due date), then you can click `Add` and that will migrate your task to the table that contains your to-do list.

### How do I remove an item from my list?

Using the table's row of where your item is, click on whatever you want to delete and then click `Remove Item`, which will delete the item you selected from your to-do list.

### How do I edit the description of an item?

You should first write your updated description in the text field you used to create an item. Once that is done, click `Edit Description` and your item description should reflect what you wrote in the text field.

### How do I edit an item's due date?

Similar to editing a description, you should select a new date on the calendar found in the due date field. Once that is done, click `Edit Due Date` and your new due date should be reflected on the to-do list table.

### How do I edit the completion status of an item?

You should first select the row the item is found on and click `Edit Completion`. Once that is done, the table should reflect the updated completion status of the item chose.

### How do I clear all the items within a list?

This is done by simply pressing the `Clear` button, which will remove all the items within the table.

### How do I display certain items? How are they filtered?

The filter displays are based on the completion status of an item, and this is achieved by clicking `View Completed Items`, `View Uncompleted Items`, and `View All`. By pressing these buttons, the table will display your items based on what has and has not been completed.

### How do I save and load my to-do lists? What file options do I have?

Before you can start saving anything, you should first write the file name for the list you want to store in the text file (also indicated with the label above). Once that is done, you click `Submit` that should save the to-do list in your root directory, found in a `lists` file. Saving programs is essentially the same process, but you type in the file name you saved your to-do list under and click `Submit`. All of these are saved with .csv files, there are no other file options.
